# Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression
This project aims to use linear regression, a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, to predict the selling price of a house based on various factors.
#### The project involves the following steps:
- Data collection and cleaning: The data for this project comes from  Kaggle
- The data is cleaned and processed to remove any errors, missing values, outliers, or irrelevant variables.
- Exploratory data analysis and feature engineering: The data is explored and analyzed using descriptive statistics and visualization techniques to understand the distribution, correlation, and trends of the variables.
- Feature engineering is performed to create new variables or transform existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model.
- Model building and evaluation: Linear regression models are built using Python, pandas, stats models, and scikit-learn libraries. The models are evaluated using metrics such as R-squared, mean squared error, and root mean squared error to measure how well they fit the data and how accurate they are in predicting house prices.
- Result interpretation and visualization: The coefficients and significance of the regression models are interpreted to understand the impact of each variable on the house price. The results and predictions are visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to show the relationship between the variables and the house price.
